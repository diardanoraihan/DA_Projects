According to [Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/india/swiggy-clocks-over-9000-orders-zomato-crosses-7000-orders-per-minute-on-new-years-eve-10250391.html), on 31 December 2021, Zomato have touched a high of 7.100 orders per minute (~ 118 orders per second). Therefore, just imagine how large the amount of data have been generated by its customers.\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "Now, we will try to analyze and squeeze possibly every insight of the data so that it will be worthwhile for our decision-making in the future. What makes this project interesting is that the type of data we have collected is . . . . . ; Then, what type of analysis we can perform on this Zomato data? \n",
    "- Graphical Analysis - what are those outlets and where exactly are those outlets present in your region?\n",
    "- What are the most famous dishes of a particular restaurant? \n",
    "- What are most popular cuisines in your region? \n",
    "- What is the relationship between rating vs price for Zomato's restaurant (online order available) and non-restaurant (online order not available)?\n",
    "- What is the highest-rated restaurant in your region?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Target Audience\n",
    "__Entrepreneurs__ who are passionate about opening a restaurant in a city would be very interested in this project. The project is also for __business owners__ and __stakeholders__ who want to expand their businesses by collaborating with any foodtech and wonder how data science could be applied to the questions at hand."
